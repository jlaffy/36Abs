initial script version commits on 27/7/15

#Background
exploring proABC server (and DIGIT) with 12 forbidden (predicted to be autoreactive) heavy chain sequences and 3 public (promiscuous/used widely by H chains) light chains

#Prior to 27/7
====DIGIT=====
==============
====ProABC====
1. immh103_M_UN_29876 and preh159_M_V3_60711, when paired with imml103 lambda light chain and inputted to proABC, cause the server to detect the following error: "Unexpected gaps in FRH3. Please be aware that some results will be innacurate because of this". In the case of immh159MV-6, the antibody cannot be modelled by proABC, nor therefore can the antigen contacts be predicted. In the case of immh103MU-2, the method of sequence input affects proABC's ability to effectuate modelling and predictions: copy and pasting the sequence into heavy chain seq box does not allow anything to happen. uploading immh103MU-2 seq in .ali file format allows a model and contact predictions to be made. However, the CDRH3 region is entirely cut off from the contact predictions.
NOTE: Catherine: "I've compared both FR3 regions with the IMGT V3-15 germline FR3 region and both are identical to the germline - i.e. according to IMGT there is nothing missing." !!!! [Franca: Send them an email]
 
2. The CDR3 regions of the heavy chain sequences, which along with the other CDRs and FRs are predicted by proABC, do not match the predictions given by Catherine -and thus (presumably) by IMGT. However the difference is only small, usually only the three commencing letters (CTT) which IMGT/Catherine supposes as the start of the CDRH3 and proABC supposes as the end of FRH3. 

3. Retrievable from proABC: heavy and light chain contact probabilities (all non-bonded interactions, hydrophobic and H bonds respectively) in .csv format; pdb model, with B-factor values replaced with contact probabilities; summary page stating all CDR and FR sequences, but length not given only content is (the content includes alignment however ie. RISK------SGGGYYT-- etc.
============== 
======R=======
1. Graphs to easily show which residues increase/decrease in antigen-contact probability upon an increase/decrease in antigen volume (smaller or larger than ~1.5Ã…^2 is field provided by proABC).
2. Graphs also show variable region key, so as to note whether residue 99 is in FR3 or CDR3 for example.
3. Tables, outputted in .csv format, with 3 columns: (1) a.a.position; (2) a.a.seq; (3) difference in contact probability (when big vs (or -) small vol of antigen).
==============
1.Bash script > runs R script > edits R script sequence ids > runs R script again > repeat for all 12 heavy chains. 
2.R script > make a graph, include CDR/FR legend

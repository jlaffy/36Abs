Modelling "reactive" antibodies and their "non-reactive" light- and heavy- recombinants

Tihomir conducted ELISAs on antibodies in DDW spreadsheet. 4 of these were selected for polyreactivity, as assessed by their binding to DNA, insulin, LPS and Hep2.The heavy and light chain sequences were searched on IMGT/V-QUEST for each of these antibodies and the results downloaded as a spreadsheet from IMGT (see in '~/reactiveIG-tihomir/data' directory). AA sequences taken from 'AA sequence' sheet of spreadsheet under 'V-D-J region' column or 'V-J region' column depending on the spreadsheet (heavy vs light chain respectively). Fasta files made. In project root directory on 27-10-15.

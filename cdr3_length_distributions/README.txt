18/9/15. Preparing data for CDRH3 length distributions of available PDB structures. Used the CDR search (by attribute) service on SAbDab. Restrictions on which PDB structures were included are stated below.

The cdr3 (organism not specified) files contain human antibodies only, resolved by X-ray diffraction at a resolution of 3Ã… or less and whereby CDRH3 information was complete. Total of 707 structures. 

The homo/mus files have all the same restrictions as above, with the exception that they include mouse antibodies also.
